  - Enviroment variables ${URL}, ${USER} and ${API_TOKEN}
  - The api url should end with ".../api/v4"
  - Swagger UI in "container:8001/swagger-ui/index.html"
  - Swagger UI Parameters
    - repoName: Repository Name
    - projectNamespace: Project Namespace

- Image2
  - Enviroment variables ${URL} and ${API_TOKEN}
  - A mysql database in port 3306 with an schema buildimage is needed. The user and password should be "root" (both).

  - Swagger UI Parameters
    - name: Build Name
    - pathRepo: Build pathRepo

  - Id is an autogenerated int, so its not needed


Sadly, I had no time for Unit tests or to test the Dockerfiles, but the code should work (Image1 tested against a personal gitlab account, Image2 tested with a local mysql8 database)

PS: I had already uploaded everything before realizing it should be only the src folder. However, I had developed the dockerfile with the idea of using a .jar (maybe it wasn't the best idea, but I had done it in another project before and ended up doing it that way), so I would still need access to the target folder.

PSS: Como el pdf venía en inglés, lo escribí todo (o casi todo) en inglés para no andar saltando entre idiomas. Perdón por los posibles fallos ;)
